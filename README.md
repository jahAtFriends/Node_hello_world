# Hello Homework

This is meant to be a relatively simple assignment, but I'm including all the extra stuff
so you can try it in Codespaces first. In any case, here is the assignment:

In the root folder there is a file called `in.txt `. Write a script that reads the first
line of this file and says hello to the name on that line by writing a new file called
`out.txt` which contains the phrase "Hello, {name}" depending on the name read from the
first file.

As an extension to this, consider allowing `in.txt` to contain multiple names, one per
line and saying hello to each of them individually in `out.txt`.

**Copilot Rules**: Do not use AI for this assignment.

_This assignment is graded for completion not correctness._
